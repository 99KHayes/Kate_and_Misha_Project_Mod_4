POSSIBLE QUESTIONS OF THE DATASET:

Randy thinks here is a correlation between complaints that pass and those volatility
properties. He thinks that we get complaints on those things that are
just boarder-line good.

starting on page 14 of the Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition
Engine Fuel paper (volatility, vapor pressure, etc.)

Logistic Regression:
- Understand if any of the variables we have can predict failure of any of the three
tests of interest (location, time of year, etc.)
- Can we predict complaint outcomes by looking at vapor pressure. In this scenario,
we would need to bin the vapor pressure and find a range that is just barely
above passing. We would then filter the data (we only want to look at complaints
where the gas station passed)


Time Series:
- predict seasons of failures and/ or complaints (do you get more complaints in a certain season?)

Linear Regression:
- see if you can find a connection between relative density and flashpoint

Chart Ideas:
- chart of distribution for test results for the main volatility tests that we are looking at (want to put lines where
it's allowed (where it passes the test))

- I think it might be interesting to look at violin plots comparing seasonality for the gas grades. Diesel vs. Gasoline
