POSSIBLE QUESTIONS OF THE DATASET:

Randy thinks here is a correlation between complaints that pass and those volatility
properties. He thinks that we get complaints on those things that are good, but are
just boarderline good.

starting on page 14 of the Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition
Engine Fuel paper (volatility, vapor pressure, etc.)

- The different fuel specs change with season (the fuel specs change every two months).

- would regression work on this project? Kate sees this as a t-test problem.

- predict seasons of failures and/ or complaints (do you get more complaints in a certain season?)

- chart of distribution for test results for the main volatility tests that we are looking at (want to put lines where
it's allowed (where it passes the test))

- I think it might be interesting to look at violin plots comparing seasonality for the gas grades. Diesel vs. Gasoline
