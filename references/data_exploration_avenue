POSSIBLE QUESTIONS OF THE DATASET:

Randy thinks here is a correlation between complaints that pass and those volatility
properties. He thinks that we get complaints on those things that are 
just boarder-line good.

starting on page 14 of the Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition
Engine Fuel paper (volatility, vapor pressure, etc.)

Logistic Regression: 
- Understand if any of the variables we have can predict failure of any of the three tests of interest (location, time of year, etc.) 


Season: 
- predict seasons of failures and/ or complaints (do you get more complaints in a certain season?)

Chart Ideas: 
- chart of distribution for test results for the main volatility tests that we are looking at (want to put lines where
it's allowed (where it passes the test))

- I think it might be interesting to look at violin plots comparing seasonality for the gas grades. Diesel vs. Gasoline
