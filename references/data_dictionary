# NOTES ON THE DATASET #
########################

Note: a number of tests are run on each sample. This means that each sample has more than one row associated with it.
- Need to figure out which tests have a min and max result (the min and max result will be different depending no the season)

# QUESTIONS #
#############
- should we work with the data in sql database (might be easier to manipulate and get subsets, but I don't know)?
